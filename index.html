    <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>im so sorry i really am i didnt mean for it to go this way i love you so much but its never gonna be the same im sorry i missed you so much i couldnt stop thinking about you, you were the only thing on my mind i was thinking about you constantly a unhealthy amount i think and now i cant get over you, you are so perfect i love you so so much i loved you for all of your flaws and perfections you were so pretty and i never thought a girl as pretty as you would ever talk to me and now that if i end up going to your school im gonna have to see you probaly everyday which is gonna be so great for me since we cant talk anymore. 
      i need to grow up why am i never fucking serious bro no wonder i get left all the time and get looked at weird, 
      idk whats wrong with me but something is i never mean to take it out on other people but im just a shitty person i cant take the guilt i just wanna stop waking up i cant stand the pain of making mistakes over and over again im tired of being a fuck up why do i ruin everything bro. fuck this ive never made a proper choice in my fucken life ever and im not getting anywhere anyway im a fucking bitch a wining little dope addicted bitch who is, weird, annoying, ugly, retarded, to clingy,
      im just fucked okay idk why people dont believe me i try telling them and then i get to close to them and they end up leaving me idk if i can do this anymore i think i gotta put on a mask and act since my true self is  to weird and i hate myself. and i hated it but what can you do about it if nobody cares? lol XD 
    well i mean if ur actaully reading this heres smt to know about me. well i mean im most likely just attention seeking but seriosuly im the biggest pussy ever i cant kms ive tried multiple times over 3 or 4 years i never can get myself to do it tho the closest i got to was when i was sitting down choking on a cord that was hanging me from my towel rack in my bathroom in year 7 and to be clear i suck at tying nooses i literally made like fucking 5, 3 with rope but redid them multiple times bc they were so shit lol im not even good at killing myself how fucking sad am i when will i just dont wanna wake up idk what im supposed to do 
    what the actauly fuck is wrong with me what am i even saying i fucking hate this shit im sick of this my life is supposed to be good but idk it really doesnt feel like it im tired of waking up i dont even go to school anymore i dont do anything i dont work i dont study i dont do fuck all except smoke and game sometimes like even i dont like gaming anymore im just to tired i cbf doing anything i just stare at my screen asking myself what tf am i doing then i hop off like in 1 min looking for a new game with no success most of the time idk everythings just boring nothing is fun anymore it feels weird 
    also idk if you really liked me either idk if thats just the way you show love or whatever but when we first met you used to be so nice and open but when we got to know eachother you become distant and i regret everything now im so sorry you had to meet me and im sorry that im here alive and that you might have to see me in person im such a fuck up im sorry i didnt mean to change however i did but i cant blame you for any of this it is all my fault i wasnt good enough for you i really sucked and i genuinely thought i was good enough but i always do this i always ruin relationships i have with the people i love the most idk whats wrong with me i cant do this im tired of fucking up i dont want to fuck up anymore i never do anything right,
      all i wanted was someone to love me tho, someone to guide me, someone to be there for me when i needed them, someone to actaully like me for who i am, just anyone i just want someone to love im tired of being alone most of the time but i mean thats on me for being this way idk why i cant just talk to people normally and why i cant keep a proper relationship with people without getting left or hurt
    oki goodbye for now -12/28/2025 3:51PM</p>
